# DOUG APP -- READ ME

This is Doug's birthday present. It's a simple app powered by Python (the instructor prompting library) and (for the moment) OpenAI's GPT-4o.

It takes in photos of the front and back of a used book, and uses them to generate a description, a condition estimate ("like New", "Excellent", "Good", "Fair"), and extract the book's title.

That's it! It may do more eventually, and of course ideally it might be a mobile app powered by an on-device model.
